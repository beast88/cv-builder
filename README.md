# CV Builder

A React App that allows users to create a CV/Resume for themselves.

This project is part of The Odin Project course on React JS located here:

https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/cv-application

The project was designed to give me an understanding of some of the basic priciples of using React.

Users are able to update their personal information and enter details on their education and work experience.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
